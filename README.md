Intuitive Movie Recommendations for You

## 🛠️ Getting Started

After cloning the repository, you need to install the required dependencies. The Python version used while developing the framework is `3.12.3`. It is highly recommended to create a Python virtual environment using `python -m venv [myenv]` and then, install the required dependencies in the `requirements.txt` using the below command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Launching the Framework

TBD

## 👨🏻‍💻 Contribution

- In case you add new dependencies, do not forget to add them to `requirements.txt` using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` (you may need to remove the current file to have an updated version!).
